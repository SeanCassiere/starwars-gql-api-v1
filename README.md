# Star Wars GraphQL - API Project

Further in my learning of GraphQL, I've connected this Express GraphQL Server to the https://swapi.dev/ API for retrieving Star Wars character data.

### Setup and Run the project

First you'll need to clone the repository.

```
# Use SSH (if set up)...
git clone git@github.com:SeanCassiere/starwars-gql-api-v1.git YOUR_FOLDER

# ...or use HTTPS and switch remotes later.
git clone https://github.com/SeanCassiere/git@github.com:SeanCassiere/starwars-gql-api-v1.git YOUR_FOLDER
```

Once the repo is cloned, be sure to setup your environment variables (`.env`) file. You can find out the data to be added in this file, by checking out the example file provided `.env.example`.

After completing the steps above, you can run the server with the following command;

```
# launch the server
npm run server

or

yarn run server
```

Enjoy!
