# Star Wars GraphQL - React Project

Further in my learning of GraphQL, I've connected this Express GraphQL Server to the https://swapi.dev/ API for retrieving Star Wars character data.

### Setup and Run the project

First you'll need to clone the repository.

```
# Use SSH (if set up)...
git clone git@github.com:SeanCassiere/git@github.com:SeanCassiere/starwars-gql-cra-app-v1.git YOUR_FOLDER

# ...or use HTTPS and switch remotes later.
git clone https://github.com/SeanCassiere/git@github.com:SeanCassiere/starwars-gql-cra-app-v1.git YOUR_FOLDER
```

Currently, the frontend is not yet setup.
You can visit the Apollo playground by:

```
# change into the server directory
cd server

# launch the server
npm run server

or

yarn run server
```
